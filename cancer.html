        <div class="Arthritis_about">Cancer is a disease in which some of the bodyâ€™s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 

            Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.
